career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I recently graduated from the University of Cape Town with a BSc in 
      Electrical and Computer Engineering. I currenty work as a freelancer 
      involved in developing IoT sensor/control systems and writing software.

education:
    - degree: BSc in Electrical and Computer Engineering
      university: University of Cape Town
      time: 2015 - 2018
      details: |
        I thoroughly enjoyed my undergraduate studies especially in areas 
        around electronic design, digital signal processing, control 
        theory and computer science. My final year project involved designing a Stewart platform which 
        was capable of simulating ocean dynamics involving a mix of many 
        of my interests.
        
        Accomplishments:
          - University of Cape Town's representative for the SAIEE National Student Competition 2018
          - Dean's Merit List for academic excellence 2015 - 2018
          - Golden Key Society invitation (top 15% of students) 2015 - 2018

experiences:

    - role: Lab Assistant
      time: 2017 - 2018
      company: University of Cape Town's Rapid Acceleration and Manoeuvrability Group, Cape Town
      details: |
        During my December vacation I worked in a robotics lab developing a 
        high bandwidth, low latency interface which could be used by researchers 
        in the lab to communicate with quadroped or bipedal robots as they ran 
        across a testing track. The project involved using the EtherCAT protocol 
        as well as writing an API and GUI (written in C#).
        
    - role: Software Developer Intern
      time: 2017
      company: weFix, Cape Town
      details: |
        During my internship at weFix I worked in a software engineering team 
        as a backend web developer. I developed several APIs for various 
        business tools as well as upgrading the existing database architecture.

      Below are some of my projects or projects I have been involved with:

    assignments:
      - title: The Stewart Platform as an Ocean Dynamics Simulator
        link: "#hook"
        tagline: "This project was my final year engineering project where I 
        designed, built and tested a Stewart platform to assess its viability 
        as an ocean wave simulator."
        
      - title: Images via Sound
        link: "#hook"
        tagline: "This project involved writing software which could encode/decode image 
        data into/from a sound clip or 'chirp'. This involved mapping parts of the image 
        to a frequency spectrum and decoding it using steganography."
