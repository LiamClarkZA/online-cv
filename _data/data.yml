  summary: |
      I recently graduated from the University of Cape Town (UCT) with a BSc in Electrical 
      and Computer Engineering. I am currently working on my MSc degree as part of the 
      Rapid Acceleration and Manoeuvrability group in the University of Cape Town’s 
      Mechatronics laboratory. I also work as a freelance software developer when I have 
      time available.

education:

    degree: "MSc in Electrical Engineering"
    details: "In working towards my MSc, I work as part of the Rapid Acceleration and Manoeuvrability (RAM) \n\
        group in UCT’s Mechatronics laboratory where I am exploring techniques for constructing \n\
        3D skeletal pose estimates of cheetahs from video footage to study their locomotion. \n\
        This combines a range of areas I am passionate about including computer vision, artificial \n\
        intelligence and high-performance computing.\n\n\
        The overarching goal for my MSc is to develop a markerless 3D motion-capture system. \n\
        This is comprised of a set of tools which can be used to capture the 3D pose of a subject \n\
        from video footage without the need for markers to be placed on them (unlike most commercially \n\
        available motion-capture systems at the moment).\n\

        I thoroughly enjoyed my undergraduate studies especially in areas 
        around electronics design, digital signal processing, control theory 
        and computer science. One of my main highlights was my final year 
        project which involved designing a Stewart platform which was capable 
        of simulating ocean dynamics. This project was ultimately successful 
        and I was asked to present several talks on the project including one 
        at the SAIEE (South African Institute of Electrical Engineers) National 
        Student Competition.
        
        Accomplishments:
          - Graduated with First Class Honors with the class medal for Electrical and Computer Engineering (top weighted average for year of graduation) 2018
          - Winner of the provincial round for the SAIEE National Student Competition in the Western Cape 2018
          - University of Cape Town's representative for the SAIEE National Student Competition 2018
          - Dean's Merit List for academic excellence 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018

    company: "University of Cape Town's Electrical Engineering Department, Cape Town"
    details: |
        In the 1st semester of 2019 I worked as a teaching assistant for the EEE3088F electrical engineering 
        design course. This mostly involved managing the admin related to the course including tasks like managing 
        a group of tutors, marking, tutoring, managing assignments and tests and invigilating tests and exams.

    details: |
        During my 2017 December vacation I worked in a robotics lab implementing a 
        high bandwidth, low latency interface which could be used by researchers 
        in the lab to communicate with quadroped or bipedal robots as they ran 
        across a testing track. The project involved using the EtherCAT protocol 
        as well as writing an API and GUI (written in C#).

        During my internship at weFix I worked in a software engineering team 
        as a backend web developer. I developed several APIs for various 
        business tools as well as upgrading the existing database architecture.
