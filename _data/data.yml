career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
	I recently graduated from the University of Cape Town (UCT) with a BSc in Electrical 
	and Computer Engineering. I am currently working on my MSc degree as part of the 
	Rapid Acceleration and Manoeuvrability group in the University of Cape Town’s 
	Mechatronics laboratory. I also work as a freelance software developer when I have 
	time available.

education:
    - degree: MSc in Electrical Engineering
      university: University of Cape Town
      time: 2019 - Present
      details: |
        In working towards my MSc, I work as part of the Rapid Acceleration and Manoeuvrability (RAM) 
	group in UCT’s Mechatronics laboratory where I am exploring techniques for constructing 
	3D skeletal pose estimates of cheetahs from video footage to study their locomotion. 
	This combines a range of areas I am passionate about including computer vision, artificial 
	intelligence and high-performance computing.
	
	The overarching goal for my MSc is to develop a markerless 3D motion-capture system. 
	This is comprised of a set of tools which can be used to capture the 3D pose of a subject 
	from video footage without the need for markers to be placed on them (unlike most commercially 
	available motion-capture systems at the moment).
          
    - degree: BSc in Electrical and Computer Engineering
      university: University of Cape Town
      time: 2015 - 2018
      details: |
        I thoroughly enjoyed my undergraduate studies especially in areas 
        around electronics design, digital signal processing, control theory 
        and computer science. One of my main highlights was my final year 
        project which involved designing a Stewart platform which was capable 
        of simulating ocean dynamics. This project was ultimately successful 
        and I was asked to present several talks on the project including one 
        at the SAIEE (South African Institute of Electrical Engineers) National 
        Student Competition.
        
        Accomplishments:
          - Graduated with First Class Honors with the class medal for Electrical and Computer Engineering (top weighted average for year of graduation) 2018
          - Winner of the provincial round for the SAIEE National Student Competition in the Western Cape 2018
          - University of Cape Town's representative for the SAIEE National Student Competition 2018
          - Dean's Merit List for academic excellence 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018
          - Golden Key Society invitation (top 15% of students) 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018

experiences:
    - role: Teaching Assistant
      time: 2019
      company: University of Cape Town's Electrical Engineering Department, Cape Town
      details: |
        In the 1st semester of 2019 I worked as a teaching assistant for the EEE3088F electrical engineering 
	design course. This mostly involved managing the admin related to the course including tasks like managing 
	a group of tutors, marking, tutoring, managing assignments and tests and invigilating tests and exams.

    - role: Lab Assistant
      time: 2017 - 2018
      company: University of Cape Town's Rapid Acceleration and Manoeuvrability Group, Cape Town
      details: |
        During my 2017 December vacation I worked in a robotics lab implementing a 
        high bandwidth, low latency interface which could be used by researchers 
        in the lab to communicate with quadroped or bipedal robots as they ran 
        across a testing track. The project involved using the EtherCAT protocol 
        as well as writing an API and GUI (written in C#).
        
    - role: Software Developer Intern
      time: 2017
      company: weFix, Cape Town
      details: |
        During my internship at weFix I worked in a software engineering team 
        as a backend web developer. I developed several APIs for various 
        business tools as well as upgrading the existing database architecture.

      Below are some of my undergraduate projects I have been involved with:

    assignments:
      - title: The Stewart Platform as an Ocean Dynamics Simulator
#        link: "#hook"
        tagline: "This project was my final year engineering project where I 
        designed, built and tested a Stewart platform to assess its viability 
        as an ocean wave simulator."
        
      - title: Images via Sound
#        link: "#hook"
        tagline: "This project involved writing software which could encode/decode 
        image data into/from a sound clip or 'chirp'. This involved mapping parts of 
        the image to a frequency spectrum and decoding it using steganography."
        
      - title: Audio Hardware Accelerator
#        link: "#hook"
        tagline: "This project involved developing a parallel hardware accelerator (which was 
        implemented on a Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA) which could apply effects in the form of 
        FIR or IIR filters to an audio stream in real-time."
