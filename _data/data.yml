  summary: |
      I recently graduated from the University of Cape Town (UCT) with a BSc in Electrical 
      and Computer Engineering. I am currently working on my MSc degree as part of the 
      Rapid Acceleration and Manoeuvrability group in the University of Cape Town’s 
      Mechatronics laboratory. I also work as a freelance software developer when I have 
      time available.
  title: Career Profile
education: 
  - 
    degree: MSc in Electrical Engineering
    time: 2019 - Present
    university: University of Cape Town
    details: In working towards my MSc, I work as part of the Rapid Acceleration and Manoeuvrability (RAM)
        group in UCT’s Mechatronics laboratory where I am exploring techniques for constructing
        3D skeletal pose estimates of cheetahs from video footage to study their locomotion.
        This combines a range of areas I am passionate about including computer vision, artificial
        intelligence and high-performance computing.
        The overarching goal for my MSc is to develop a markerless 3D motion-capture system.
        This is comprised of a set of tools which can be used to capture the 3D pose of a subject
        from video footage without the need for markers to be placed on them (unlike most commercially
        available motion-capture systems at the moment).

    degree: BSc in Electrical and Computer Engineering
    time: 2015 - 2018
    university: University of Cape Town
    details: |
        I thoroughly enjoyed my undergraduate studies especially in areas 
        around electronics design, digital signal processing, control theory 
        and computer science. One of my main highlights was my final year 
        project which involved designing a Stewart platform which was capable 
        of simulating ocean dynamics. This project was ultimately successful 
        and I was asked to present several talks on the project including one 
        at the SAIEE (South African Institute of Electrical Engineers) National 
        Student Competition.
        
        Accomplishments:
          - Graduated with First Class Honors with the class medal for Electrical and Computer Engineering (top weighted average for year of graduation) 2018
          - Winner of the provincial round for the SAIEE National Student Competition in the Western Cape 2018
          - University of Cape Town's representative for the SAIEE National Student Competition 2018
          - Dean's Merit List for academic excellence 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018
          - Golden Key Society invitation (top 15% of students) 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018

experiences: 
  - 
    company: University of Cape Town's Electrical Engineering Department, Cape Town
    role: Teaching Assistant
    time: 2019
    details: |
        In the 1st semester of 2019 I worked as a teaching assistant for the EEE3088F electrical engineering 
        design course. This mostly involved managing the admin related to the course including tasks like managing 
        a group of tutors, marking, tutoring, managing assignments and tests and invigilating tests and exams.
  - 
    company: University of Cape Town's Rapid Acceleration and Manoeuvrability Group, Cape Town
    role: Lab Assistant
    time: 2017 - 2018
    details: |
        During my 2017 December vacation I worked in a robotics lab implementing a 
        high bandwidth, low latency interface which could be used by researchers 
        in the lab to communicate with quadroped or bipedal robots as they ran 
        across a testing track. The project involved using the EtherCAT protocol 
        as well as writing an API and GUI (written in C#).
  - 
    company: weFix, Cape Town
    role: Software Developer Intern
    time: 2017
    details: |
        During my internship at weFix I worked in a software engineering team 
        as a backend web developer. I developed several APIs for various 
        business tools as well as upgrading the existing database architecture.

  intro: > 
    Below are some of my undergraduate projects I have been involved with:
  assignments: 
    - 
      tagline: This project was my final year engineering project where I designed, built and tested a Stewart platform to assess its viability as an ocean wave simulator.
      title: The Stewart Platform as an Ocean Dynamics Simulator
    - 
      tagline: This project involved writing software which could encode/decode image data into/from a sound clip or 'chirp'. This involved mapping parts of the image to a frequency spectrum and decoding it using steganography.
      title: Images via Sound
    - 
      tagline: This project involved developing a parallel hardware accelerator (which was implemented on a Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA) which could apply effects in the form of FIR or IIR filters to an audio stream in real-time.
